        <p>
          I was introduced to coding during my freshman year of college when I
          took a crash course on FreeCodeCamp. Ever since then, I've really
          enjoyed it. There's something amazing about seeing my ideas come to
          life on the screen. Plus, as a Black Muslim woman in the tech
          industry, Iâ€™m happy to represent diversity in this space.{" "}
