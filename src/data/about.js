	"I was introduced to coding during my freshman year of college when I took a crash course on FreeCodeCamp. Ever since then, I've really enjoyed it. There's something amazing about seeing my ideas come to life on the screen. Plus, as a Black Muslim woman in the tech industry, I’m happy to represent diversity in this space. ",
	"I began tutoring elementary aged kids in the summer of 2022, and it has been such a rewarding experience. I loved working with kids and getting to see their confidence grow as they learn. Each student has their own story, and even they have taught me so many things along the way.",
	"In fall of 2023, I started a women’s hiking group at my mosque, and it has been a great success! We’ve explored beautiful spots around Birmingham, like Red Mountain, Ruffner Mountain, and Moss Rock Preserve. I also enjoy hitting the trails on my own to clear my mind after a long week. Recently, I’ve been getting into running. I’m excited to say I ran my first 5k in October!",
	"This year, I started exploring my creative side through crocheting and sewing. It’s been so much fun to see such simple materials transform into my very own unique projects. I love how these hobbies let me express myself while also being a great way to spend my free time, especially since I’ve been looking for more meaningful ways to use it."
